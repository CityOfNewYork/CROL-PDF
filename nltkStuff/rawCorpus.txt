Release of the Draft Scope of Work for Water for the Future Upstate Water Supply Resiliency Project and Schedule of Public Meetings  To repair significant leaks in the Rondout-West Branch Tunnel (RWBT) of the Delaware Aqueduct, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) developed the Water for the Future Program (WFF). As part of the program, DEP elected to construct a bypass tunnel and two associated shafts to permanently circumvent the leaking section of the tunnel at the Roseton crossing in the Town of Newburgh, NY, and to conduct internal repairs to the leaking section in Wawarsing, NY. This project was previously evaluated in a FEIS issued on May 18, 2012, and work has commenced.  Once the tunnel and shafts are completed in 2022, the RWBT would be temporarily shut down and drained to connect the bypass tunnel to the existing RWBT and to carry out internal repairs. DEP estimates that the maximum shutdown duration would be approximately eight months. During this temporary shutdown of the RWBT, water from the Delaware system west of the Hudson River would be unavailable. To ensure the continued supply of clean drinking water during this time, DEP has developed projects and plans comprised of three main components: (1) supply augmentation consisting of rehabilitation of the Catskill Aqueduct and rehabilitation of groundwater supply stations in Queens; (2) WFF Shutdown System Operations, which would allow DEP to rely more heavily on the Catskill and Croton water supply systems during the temporary shutdown; and (3) Inspection and Repair of the RWBT during connection of the bypass tunnel, including decommissioning the bypassed section of the RWBT once the connection is completed.  The subject of this draft scope and EIS is comprised of the rehabilitation of the Catskill Aqueduct, WFF Shutdown System Operations, and Inspection and Repair of the RWBT. These components collectively will be referred to as Upstate Water Supply Resiliency in the Draft Scope of Work. The Queens Groundwater Rehabilitation project will be referred to as In-City Water Supply Resiliency, which will be the subject of a subsequent environmental review.  The public comment period will remain open until December 5, 2014, and a Final Scope of Work, incorporating changes based on relevant comments received, will be issued.    The Draft Scope of Work was issued on October 10, 2014 and is available for review on the DEP website. DEP will hold public meetings for public comment on the Upstate Water Supply Resiliency Draft Scope of Workwith informal information and listening sessions taking place one hour prior to the meeting timeson:  Thursday, November 13, 2014, at 7:00 PM  Town of Newburgh Town Hall, 1496 Route 300, Newburgh, NY 12550  Friday, November 14, 2014, at 7:00 PM  SUNY Sullivan Paul Grossinger Dining Room  112 College Road, Loch Sheldrake, NY 12759  Wednesday, November 19, 2014, at 7:00 PM  Ellenville Government Center, 2 Elting Court, Ellenville, NY 12428  Thursday, November 20, 2014 at 7:00 PM  Yorktown Town Hall, Town Board Room  363 Underhill Avenue, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598

The New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Housing and Homelessness Prevention. In advance of the release of the RFP, HRA is issuing a concept paper which outlines the program model of the Homelessness Prevention Law Project (HPLP) program (RFP). The HPLP program has existed for over a decade, but as of fiscal Year 2015, the City of New York (City) moved the HPLP program from the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) to the Human Resources Administration (HRA). The HPLP program provides an array of legal services that help ensure that low-income families facing eviction or other potential loss of housing remain housed and avoid becoming homeless and entering shelters. HRA's Office of Housing and Homelessness Prevention is seeking qualified service providers to provide HPLP services in all five boroughs. The concept paper has been posted on the Agency's website at www.nyc.gov/hra/contracts

39-41 West 23rd Street CEQR 14DCP167M- NEGATIVE DECLARATION The Applicant, 39 W. 23rd Street, LLC, is seeking a special permit pursuant to Zoning Resolution (ZR) Section 74-711 to modify the rear yard equivalent regulations of Section 43-28, the rear yard regulations of Section 43-313, the streetwall height and sky exposure plane regulations of Section 43-43, and the use regulations of Section 42-10 to allow Use Group 2 residential uses. The Applicant is also seeking a special permit pursuant to Section 13-451 to allow for an accessory parking garage (collectively, the "proposed actions"). The proposed actions would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to construct a 128,713 gross square foot (gsf) mixed use building on a single zoning lot (Block 825, Lots 20, 60, and 1001-1005, the "project site"). The project site is located at 39-41 West 23rd Street and 20-22 West 24th Street in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan, Community District 5. The project site is located in an M1-6 zoning district and is within the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC) designated Ladies' Mile Historic District. The proposed actions would facilitate a proposal by the Applicant to transfer approximately 24,000 gsf of unused development rights from Lot 1001-1005 to Lots 20 and 60 in order to construct a new, mixed use residential and commercial 128,713 gsf building. The Applicant's development proposal would consist of 119,173 gsf of residential space (40 market-rate units), 2,500 gsf of retail space, and a 50-space public parking garage accessed by an existing curb cut along West 24th Street. The proposed new development would consist of two towers, a 24-story (278-foot tall) residential tower facing West 23rd Street and a 10-story (130-foot-tall) residential tower facing West 24th Street, atop a building base containing retail, parking garage, and residential lobby uses. The east side of the proposed new building would cantilever over a five-story existing building located on Lot 1001-1005. At present, Lot 20 is occupied by a public parking lot containing 42 spaces. Lot 60, located to the west of Lot 20 on West 24th Street, is currently vacant. Lot 1001-1005, located to the east of Lot 20, is currently occupied by an 80-foot-tall, residential and retail building that is a contributing building in the Ladies' Mile Historic District. For the purposes of a conservative analysis, a Reasonable Worst Case Development Scenario (RWCDS) assumes the project site would be developed with an average dwelling unit size of 1,000 gsf, smaller than the average dwelling unit size anticipated by the applicant. The RWCDS assumes the same amount of residential floor area (119,173 gsf) as the proposed project, but with 75 more dwelling units for a total of 115 market rate units. It is expected that the proposed project would be constructed and occupied by 2017. Absent the proposed actions, the Applicant has stated that Lots 20 and 60 would be developed with a seven story (77-foot-tall roof and 80-foot-tall parapet) 45,862 sf commercial building that complies with the underlying zoning regulations. The development would contain approximately 8,152 sf of retail space on the first floor and approximately 37,710 sf of office space on the upper floors. The development would require a Certificate of Appropriateness from LPC. The proposed actions include an (E) designation (E-356) applicable to a portion of the project site (Block 825, Lots 20 and 60). The (E) designation would preclude significant adverse impacts related to air quality, noise, and hazardous materials. The text for the (E) designation related to air quality is as follows: Any new residential and/or commercial development on the above-referenced properties must ensure that heating and hot water equipment exhaust stack(s) on the above-referenced property must be located at the highest tier or at least 281 feet high to avoid any potential significant air quality impacts. The text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows: To ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, the building faade(s) or future development at Block 825, Lots 20 and 60 must provide a minimum of 31 dBA composite building faade attenuation at elevations up to 100 feet above the street level and 28 dBA at elevations between 101 and 200 feet above street level for the faade along West 23rd Street for residential or other noise-sensitive uses, to provide an interior L10 noise level not greater than 45 dBA. The minimum required composite building faade attenuation for future commercial or other non-noise-sensitive uses would be 5 dBA less than for residential uses, to provide an interior L10 noise level not greater than 50 dBA. To maintain a closed-window condition in these areas, an alternate means of ventilation that brings outside air into the building without degrading the acoustical performance of the building faade(s) must also be provided. The text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows: Task 1: Sampling Protocol Prior to construction, the Applicant submits to OER, for review and approval, a Phase II Investigation protocol, including a description of methods and a site map with all sampling locations clearly and precisely represented. No sampling should begin until written approval of a protocol is received from OER. The number and location of sample sites should be selected to adequately characterize the site, the specific source of suspected contamination (i.e., petroleum-based contamination and non-petroleum-based contamination), and the remainder of the site's condition. The characterization should be complete enough to determine what remediation strategy (if any) is necessary after review of the sampling data. Guidelines and criteria for selecting sampling locations and collecting samples are provided by OER upon request. Task 2: Remediation Determination and Protocol A written report with findings and a summary of the data must be submitted to OER after completion of the testing phase and laboratory analysis for review and approval. After receiving such results, a determination is made by OER if the results indicate that remediation is necessary. If OER determines that no remediation is necessary, written notice shall be given by OER. If remediation is indicated from the test results, a proposed remedial action plan must be submitted to OER for review and approval. The Applicant must complete such remediation as determined necessary by OER. The Applicant should then provide proper documentation that the work has been satisfactorily completed. An OER-approved construction health and safety plan would be implemented during evacuation and construction and activities to protect workers and the community from potentially significant adverse impacts associated with contaminated soil and/or groundwater. This plan would be submitted to OER for review and approval prior to implementation. Statement of No Significant Effect:
PUBLIC NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the following matters have been scheduled for public hearing by Community Board: BOROUGH OF BROOKLYN  COMMUNITY BOARD NO.10 -Monday, November 17, 2014 at 7:15 P.M., The Norwegian Christian Home, 1250 67th Street, Brooklyn, NY IN THE MATTER OF BSA Special Permit Application, Calendar No. 239-14-BZ, for the legalization of an enlargement at the rear of the second floor of an existing two story dwelling in a residential zoning district (R-2) contrary to side yard and floor area requirements at 8008 Harbor View Terrace.

XU HOTEL AND RESIDENCES REZONING 13DCP106Q - NEGATIVE DECLARATION The applicant, CG & J Realty LLC, is seeking a zoning map amendment to rezone Block 4960, Lot 29 (the "project site") and part of Lots 28, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, and 63 and part of Block 4977, Lot 130, from a R6/C2-2 district to C4-3 and R6 districts in the Downtown Flushing neighborhood of Queens, Community District 7 (the "proposed action"). The proposed action would facilitate the construction of an approximately 214,539 gross square foot (gsf) eleven-story, mixed-use building containing hotel, residential, commercial, and community facility uses. The project site is located in a R6/C2-2 district which allows residential and community facility Use Groups 1 through 4, with a permitted residential floor area ratio (FAR) ranging from 0.78 to 2.43 and a community facility FAR of 4.8. The existing C2-2 commercial overlay permits Use Groups 1 through 9 and 14 and a maximum commercial FAR of 2.0. The proposed action seeks to extend the C4-3 zoning district to the south of the project site to facilitate a mixed use building with a wider range of commercial uses than what would be permitted on an as-of-right-basis. The proposed C4-3 zoning district permits Use Groups 1 through 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 and a commercial FAR of up to 3.4, a residential FAR of between 0.78 and 2.43, and a community facility FAR of up to 4.8. The project site, Block 4960, Lot 29, is currently developed with a one-story 25,300 square foot (sf) supermarket and an accessory parking lot containing 38 parking spaces. Vehicular access to the parking lot is provided via curb cuts onto Northern Boulevard and Leavitt Street. The rezoning boundary also extends beyond the project site and includes portions of the following non-Applicant owned lots: Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 63 and Block 4977, Lot 130. These parcels are not expected to be redeveloped or enlarged as a result of the proposed action. Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 62 are developed with one- to three-family residential buildings. Block 4960, Lot 63 is developed with a City owned parking lot that serves Flushing Town Hall, a Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC) designated landmark and National Register listed site located directly west of the project site. The rezoning area extends 125 feet in from the Northern Boulevard street line, therefore approximately 0.16 feet (two inches) in width of Block 4960, Lots 28 and 57 through 62 would be zoned C4-3. The remainder of the C2-2 commercial overlay would be removed from these lots and would maintain their effective R6 zoning. In addition, a portion of the Daniel Carter Beard Memorial Park mall (Block 4977, Lot 130) is within the proposed rezoning boundary. It is an open space area owned by the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation. The eastbound and westbound lanes of Northern Boulevard are divided by this partially landscaped and partially paved median strip. The proposed action would facilitate a proposal by the applicant to construct an approximately 214,539 gsf eleven-story mixed-use building on the project site. The proposed development would include approximately 43 dwelling units within 40,299 gsf of floor area, 191 hotel rooms within 103,554 gsf of floor area, 11,273 gsf of accessory retail space, and approximately 7,890 gsf of community facility space (non-profit club). The proposed development would also include 155 accessory attended parking spaces (plus 16 reservoir spaces), 33 bicycle parking spacing, and one loading berth. The cellar level of the building would be used for hotel parking and accessed from ramps on the basement level on Leavitt Street and by vehicle elevators. The first floor of the building would be used for residential parking garage and would be accessed from ramps on the basement level on Leavitt Street. The proposed project is expected to be completed by 2017. Absent the proposed action, the project site would be developed with a 174,174 gsf eleven-story mixed-use building. The building would include 72 dwelling units within 74,553 gsf of floor area, 33,771 gsf of community facility space (non-profit club), and 21,820 gsf of retail space. The proposed development would also include 143 accessory attended parking spaces (plus 15 reservoir spaces) and one loading berth. The proposed actions include an (E) designation (E-355) applicable to the project site (Block 4960, Lot 29). The (E) designation would preclude significant adverse impacts related to noise and hazardous materials. The text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows: In order to ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, future residential uses must provide a closed window condition with a minimum window-wall attenuation of 31 dB(A) along the project's Northern Boulevard faade and 28 dB(A) on other building facades in order to maintain an interior noise level of 45 dB(A). In order to maintain a closed-window condition, an alternate means of ventilation must also be provided. Alternate means of ventilation includes, but is not limited to, central air conditioning or air conditioning sleeves containing air conditioners. The text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows: Task 1 The fee owners of the lot restricted by this (E) designation will be required to prepare a scope of work for any soil, gas, or groundwater sampling and testing needed to determine if contamination exists, the extent of the contamination, and to what extent remediation may be required. The scope of work will include all relevant supporting documentation, including site plans and sampling locations. This scope of work will be submitted to the Mayor's Office of Environmental Remediation (OER) for review and approval prior to implementation. It will be reviewed to ensure that an adequate number of samples will be collected and that appropriate parameters are selected for laboratory analysis. No sampling program may begin until written approval of a work plan and sampling protocol is received from the OER. The number and location of sample sites should be selected to adequately characterize the type and extent of the contamination, and the condition of the remainder of the site. The characterization should be complete enough to determine what remediation strategy (if any) is necessary after review of the sampling data. Guidelines and criteria for choosing sampling sites and performing sampling will be provided by OER upon request. Task 2 A written report with findings and a summary of the data must be presented to OER after completion of the testing phase and laboratory analysis for review and approval. After receiving such test results, a determination will be provided by OER if the results indicate that remediation is necessary. If OER determines that no remediation is necessary, written notice shall be given by OER. If remediation is necessary according to test results, a proposed remediation plan must be submitted to OER for review and approval. The fee owners of the lot restricted by this (E) designation must perform such remediation as determined necessary by O

5402 FORT HAMILTON PARKWAY 14DCP135K - CONDITIONAL NEGATIVE DECLARATION The applicant, Fort Hamilton LLC, is seeking a zoning map amendment to rezone Block 5673, Lots 42, 50, and part of Lot 41, from R5/C1-3 to R6/C1-3, and part of Lot 20 of Block 5666 from R5 to R6 (the "proposed action"). The rezoning area is bounded by Fort Hamilton Parkway, 55th Street, 9th Avenue, and 53rd Street, and is located within the Borough Park neighborhood in Brooklyn, Community District 12. The proposed action would facilitate a proposal by the applicant to construct a 50,669 square foot (sf), mixed-use development containing 45,055 sf of community facility uses and 5,614 sf of commercial uses on Lots 42 and 50 ("project site"). The proposed development would also include an accessory parking garage with 150 spaces, accessed by a proposed curb-cut along 54th Street. The project site currently contains 11,167 square feet of lot area. Lot 42, at the southwest corner of Fort Hamilton Parkway and 54th Street, is a former auto repair establishment, consisting of a vacant garage building and paved area that is fenced and unused. Lot 50, located to the south of the corner lot and fronting on Fort Hamilton Parkway, contains a narrow, vacant three-story former mixed use building. Portions of two parcels (Lot 41 of Block 5673 and part of Lot 50 of Block 5666), not under the applicant's control, are located within the boundaries of the proposed rezoning. Lot 41, to the west of the project site, contains a three-story residential building. Lot 50, to the north of the project site, is occupied by the Monastery of the Precious Blood institution. The parcels not under the applicant's control are not expected to be redeveloped or enlarged as a result of the proposed action. The existing R5/C1-3 zoning permits a FAR of 1.25 for residential use and 2.0 for community facility uses. The proposed rezoning would increase the permitted FAR for residential use to 2.43 and community facility use to 4.8. For the purposes of a conservative analysis, the Reasonable Worst Case Development Scenario (RWCDS) analyzed in the Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS) assumes that the project site would be developed with a 99,034 gsf building containing 57,890 sf of medical office uses, 5,614 sf of retail commercial uses, and an accessory parking garage containing 151 parking spaces occupying up to 35,530 sf. The garage would be accessed via a proposed new curb cut located on 54th Street. The proposed project is expected to be constructed and occupied by 2016. Absent the proposed action, the applicant has stated that the project site would be developed with a three-story 52,272 gsf medical office and retail building pursuant to the existing R5/C1-3 zoning. An 82-space accessory parking garage, accessed via a new curb cut on 54th Street, would also be provided. The proposed action includes an (E) designation (E-341) applicable to the project site (Block 5673, Lots 42 and 50). The (E) designation would preclude significant adverse impacts related to air quality, noise, and hazardous materials. The text for the (E) designation related to air quality is as follows: Any new residential and/or commercial development on the above-referenced property must use natural gas for HVAC systems to avoid any potential significant adverse air quality impacts. The text for the (E) designation related to noise is as follows: To ensure an acceptable interior noise environment, future residential uses must provide a closed-window condition with a minimum OITC rating of 28 dBA window/wall attenuation to maintain an interior noise level of 45 dBA. To maintain a closed-window condition, an alternate means of ventilation must also be provided. Alternate means of ventilation includes, but is not limited to, air conditioning. For commercial uses, the requirement would be 5 dBA lower, or 23 dBA. The text for the (E) designation related to hazardous materials is as follows: Task 1 Sampling Protocol The fee owner of the lots restricted by this (E) designation is required to submit to OER, for review and approval, an updated Phase I of the site along with a soil, groundwater and soil vapor testing protocol, including a description of methods and a site map with all sampling locations clearly and precisely represented. No sampling shall begin until written approval of a protocol is received from OER. The number and location of samples should be selected to adequately characterize the site, specific sources of suspected contamination (i.e., petroleum based contamination and non-petroleum based contamination), and the remainder of the site's condition. The characterization should be complete enough to determine what remediation strategy (if any) is necessary after review of sampling data. Guidelines and criteria for selecting sampling locations and collecting samples are provided by OER upon request. Task 2 Remediation Determination Protocol A written report with findings and a summary of the data must be submitted to OER after completion of the testing phase and laboratory analysis for review and approval. After receiving such results, a determination is made by OER if the results indicate that remediation is necessary. If OER determines that no remediation is necessary, written notice shall be given by OER. If OER determines that remediation is necessary based on test results, a proposed remediation plan must be submitted to OER for review and approval. The fee owner of the lots must complete such remediation as determined necessary by OER. The fee owner of the lots shall then provide proper documentation that the work has been satisfactorily completed. A construction-related health and safety plan must be submitted to OER for approval and then implemented during excavation and construction activities to protect workers and the community from potentially significant adverse impacts associated with contaminated soil, groundwater and/or soil vapor.

The hearing will be in Hearing Room A at the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, located at 100 Church Street, 12th Floor, NY, NY 10007. How do I comment on the proposed rules? Anyone can comment on the proposed rules by: Website. You can submit comments to SAPO through the NYC rules Web site at www.nyc.gov/nycrules. Email. You can email written comments to saporules@cityhall.nyc.gov. Mail. You can mail written comments to Emil Lissauer, Deputy Executive Director, Citywide Coordination and Management, at 100 Gold Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10038. Fax. You can fax written comments to SAPO, 212-312-0759. By Speaking at the Hearing. Anyone who wants to comment on the proposed rule at the public hearing must sign up to speak.

A few days after the hearing, a transcript of the hearing and copies of the written comments will be available to the public at SAPO. What authorizes SAPO to make this rule? Section 1043 of the City Charter as well as Executive Orders No. 100 and No. 105 authorize SAPO to make this proposed rule. This proposed rule was not included in SAPO's regulatory agenda for this Fiscal Year because it was not contemplated when SAPO published the agenda. Where can I find the SAPO rules? The SAPO rules are in title 50 of the Rules of the City of New York. What rules govern the rulemaking process? SAPO must meet the requirements of Section 1043 of the City Charter when creating or changing rules. This notice is made according to the requirements of Section 1043 of the City Charter. Statement of Basis and Purpose of Proposed Rule  The Office of Citywide Events Coordination and Management (OCECM), Street Activity Permit Office (SAPO) administers New York City's permit system for street activities, block parties and fairs.  Each year SAPO issues permits to over 200 street fairs and over 5,000 other events, most of which include the use of multiple blocks over several days, the erection of structures, the vending of food, apparel and other goods and the use of amplified sound and the performance of music. Events like these require additional police officers which increases overtime costs to the City. These events also divert police officers from core crime fighting, public safety and counter terrorism duties.  To more effectively deploy police resources and control overtime costs, the New York City Police Department has requested that SAPO exercise its discretion temporarily to deny permits for additional events scheduled for calendar year 2015. The proposed rules will authorize SAPO to deny permits to these events only if the event was not held in the calendar year 2014. Events that received permits in calendar year 2014 will be eligible to receive permits again in calendar year 2015.  SAPO authority for these rules is found in section 1043 of the New York City Charter and Executive Order No. 105 of 2007. New material is underlined. [Deleted material is in brackets.]  "Shall" and "must" denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.  Section 1-05(d) of Chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to read as set forth below.  (d) For the calendar year [2014] 2015, the Director shall deny applications for street activity permits for street fairs not held in the calendar year [2013] 2014.

NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING and PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT PERIOD regarding both a PROPOSED LEASE BETWEEN HUDSON RIVER PARK TRUST and PIER55, INC. and a PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO HUDSON RIVER PARK'S GENERAL PROJECT PLAN  Pursuant to the Hudson River Park Act, the Hudson River Park Trust ("Trust") hereby gives notice of a public hearing to address (i) a proposed 20-year Lease, with an option to renew for a maximum 30-year Lease, between the Trust and Pier55, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation, for the redevelopment of Pier 54 and subsequent operation of a public open park space with cultural programming; and (ii) an amendment to the Hudson River Park General Project Plan originally adopted on July 16, 1998 reflecting the proposed Pier 54 redevelopment.  Date and Time: December 17, 2014, 5:30 P.M. - 8:00 P.M.  Place: Eisner and Lubin Auditorium  New York University Kimmel Center  60 Washington Square South, 4th Floor PHOTO IDENTIFICATION IS REQURED TO ENTER THE FACILITY  Purpose: To allow the public to review and comment on proposed significant plans and proposed actions within the Park pursuant to the Hudson River Park Act and Environmental Assessment Statement regarding the potential environmental impacts of the proposed action.  The Trust is providing the public an opportunity to review and comment on a proposed lease between the Trust and Pier55, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation. The proposed Lease term is 20 years, with an option to extend for ten more years, and obligates Pier55, Inc. to commit substantial funding for the reconstruction of Pier 54 (to be located between the existing Pier 54 footprint and the Pier 56 pile field) and for the on-going operation and maintenance of the completed pier. The Lease contemplates that Pier55, Inc. would redevelop the new pier as public open park space that would also serve as a cultural events space within the Park. Pier55, Inc. would fund the operations of cultural events on the new pier, with a majority of events each year to be available to the public on a free or low cost basis. The permitted events that Pier55, Inc. would fund and produce include: public performances of vocal, instrumental and other music; dramatic works, opera, theater and public readings of prose or poetry; public talks by academics, writers and public figures; performance art; dance performances; art displays, installations and exhibitions; films; and other similar events. Pier55, Inc. would also be allowed to conduct fundraising events and operate limited concessions on the pier. The Trust will also use the new pier for its programming and events. The new pier will be open and accessible to the public consistent with overall Park's operating hours, with closures limited to the extent reasonably necessary for safety or to accommodate permitted events. The proposed Lease also includes other information on security, maintenance and other operational requirements and obligations of both Pier55, Inc. and the Trust.  The proposed Lease would require a minimum design and construction financial commitment by Pier55 Inc. of over one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000). In addition, Pier55, Inc. will be responsible for all costs associated with cultural programming, and for the cost of maintaining the landscape and other pier amenities. The Lease provides that, after ten years, Pier55, Inc. may either continue to operate and maintain the pier for the remainder of the Lease term, or make a contribution to support its future maintenance. The Trust has committed to expend seventeen million dollars ($17,000,000) in City capital funds, and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in other public monies, towards Pier 54's redevelopment, and to be responsible for maintaining the support piles and other structural components of the pier.  Additionally, the 1998 Hudson River Park General Project Plan will be amended to reflect the current plans for the redevelopment of Pier 54.  A copy of the proposed Lease and Amendment to the General Project Plan Amendment can be found on the Trust's website at www.hudsonriverpark.org. A copy of a draft of the Environmental Assessment Statement for the proposed project can also be found on the Trust's website.  In addition to the public hearing, the public will have an opportunity to provide written comments to the Trust. The public comment period extends from November 17, 2014 to January 16, 2015. Comments may be sent by regular mail to William Heinzen, Esq., Hudson River Park Trust, Pier 40, 2nd Floor, 353 West Street, New York, N.Y. 10014 or by email to Pier54comments@hrpt.ny.gov.

In advance of the release of a Request for Proposals (RFP), the New York City Administration for Children's Services (ACS) is posting a concept paper setting forth the services that potential, qualified vendors will provide to older youth in care under the jurisdiction of the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. Through this RFP, ACS will seek new program models to the system which emphasize engagement of at-risk and vulnerable populations within our continuum of care, and reinforce fundamental expectations of accountability for outcomes and child and family-centered practice.  The RFP will seek appropriately qualified organizations with strong community connections geared to meet the needs of youth between the ages of 15 and 21. ACS will establish clusters of service providers in identified high-need communities where many youth involved with foster care and juvenile justice systems reside or congregate. These clustered service providers will create a continuum of high-performing, neighborhood-based organizations to collaborate with ACS in the advancement of youth development goals through innovative strategies designed to effectively engage at-risk and marginalized populations. The cluster of providers will include a blend of arts and cultural programming, educational and vocational supports, job readiness, recreational opportunities, and housing supports.  The concept paper will be posted on the ACS website, www.nyc.gov/acs under Business Opportunities from December 2, 2014 to January 20, 2015. All comments in response to the concept paper should be in writing via e-mail to: OYServicesCP@acs.nyc.gov

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE UNIT STREET ACTIVITY PERMIT OFFICE NOTICE OF ADOPTION  Subject: Notice of final rulemaking relating to amendments that pertain to the moratorium on street fair applications.  NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN THE Office of Citywide Events Coordination and Management by Executive Order No. 105 of 2007, and in accordance with Section 1043 of the Charter, that the Office of Citywide Events Coordination and Management proposes to amend Chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Official Compilation of Rules of the City of New York relating to street activity permits. This rule proposal was not included in the regulatory agenda because it was not contemplated at the time of publication of the regulatory agenda.  Notice regarding a public hearing about the amendment was first published on November 7, 2014, with the agency accepting comments until December 8, 2014. The agency was prepared to make available for public inspection all written and oral comments it received on the matter, within a reasonable time after receipt, between the hours of 9:30 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. at the Office of Citywide Events Coordination and Management, 100 Gold Street, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10038. A total of 3 comments were submitted either at the public hearing or through other means (regular mail and the NYC Rules website).  This amendment will take effect immediately. Statement of Basis and Purpose of Rule  The Office of Citywide Events Coordination and Management (OCECM), Street Activity Permit Office (SAPO) is charged with administration of the permit system for street activities, block parties and fairs.  Over two hundred SAPO-permitted street fairs and over 5,000 events occur annually within the City. Almost all of these events involve permits for the use of multiple blocks over several days, the erection of structures, the vending of food, apparel and other goods and the use of amplified sound and the performance of music. Such events require additional police presence and increase overtime expenditure by the City. In order to effectively deploy police resources, the New York City Police Department has requested for the calendar year 2015 that SAPO exercise its discretion temporarily to deny permits for additional events that place an excessive burden on police resources and divert uniformed personnel from core crime fighting, public safety and counter terrorism duties.  In the interests of protecting the City and its inhabitants, these rules will authorize SAPO to deny permits to events scheduled for calendar year 2015, the anticipated effective date of the proposed rules, if the event was not held in the calendar year 2014, the year prior to the effective date of the proposed rules.  SAPO authority for these rules is found in section 1043 of the New York City Charter and Executive Order No. 105 of 2007. New material is underlined. [Deleted material is in brackets.]  "Shall" and "must" denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.  Section 1-05(d) of Chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to read as set forth below.  (d) For the calendar year [2014] 2015, the Director shall deny applications for street activity permits for street fairs not held in the calendar year [2013] 2014. Statement of Substantial Need for Earlier Implementation  I hereby find, pursuant to Section 1043(f)(1)(c) of the New York City Charter, that there is a substantial need for the implementation, immediately upon its final publication in The City Record, of a rule to clarify practices and procedures related to permitting events on City streets, including but not limited to extending, for an additional one-year period,the authority of the Director of the Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management (OCECM), set forth in section 1-05(d) of chapter 1 of Title 50 of the Rules of the City of New York,to deny applications for street activity permits for events not held in the preceding calendar year and to promulgate a fee schedule for certain street activity permits.  Over 200 SAPO-permitted street fairs and over 5,000 events occur annually within the City. Almost all of these events involve permits for the use of multiple blocks over several days, the erection of structures, the vending of food, apparel and other goods and the use of amplified sound and the performance of music. Such events require additional police presence and increase overtime expenditure by the City. In order to effectively deploy police resources, the New York City Police Department has requested for the calendar year 2015 that SAPO exercise its discretion temporarily to deny permits for additional events that place an excessive burden on police resources and divert uniformed personnel from core crime fighting, public safety and counter terrorism duties.  In the interests of protecting the City and its inhabitants, these rules will authorize SAPO to deny permits to events for an additional year if the event was not held prior to the new effective date.
